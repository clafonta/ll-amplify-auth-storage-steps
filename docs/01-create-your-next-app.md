# Getting Started with NextJS

NextJS

## Installation

Before we begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, follow these steps to create a new React application:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following command to create a new app. 

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest ll-next-app --typescript
   ```

In this guide, we're going to use NextJS page routing. 

   ```bash   
   ✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … No / Yes
   ✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No / Yes
   ✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No / Yes
   ✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
   ✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? … No / Yes
   ```

   ```bash
   cd ll-next-app 
   ```
